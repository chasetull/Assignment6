Assignment 6

The program begins with asking the user to input the file path of the data to be sorted. The data is read in and four sorting algorithms sort it differently. Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort and Quick Sort are the algorithms acting on the data. The time it took for each algorithm to compute the data is then presented.

I had trouble implementing quickSort but was able to make it work.

I used Stack Overflow and the C++ API to help me work through the algorithms.
